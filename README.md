# VirtualProcessor
- This project is meant to represent a 32 bit Processor in Java.
- The processor can execute binary instructions from a SIA32 instruction set and create the corresponding results.
- You can write programs using the Assembler (which is included in this repository).
- This project was done for ICSI-404, Computer Organization and Architecture, at the University at Albany
- `Processor` has the majority of the code.
  - Note: The other files are used to help `Processor` or the Assembler.
